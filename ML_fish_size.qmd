## Introduction

Here we present a **simple approach to develop models for estimating fish size classes from images**. We have prepared a scripts for data pre-processing and machine learning model development, which you can find on our [Online course](https://fishsizeproject.github.io/Course-MLforImageProcessing/G-practice-4.html) webpage. 

In this [**publication**](link here) you will find a detailed description of the method and a pilot case-study where we demonstrate potential use for estimating fish size classes from images without a speficied reference object. You can also find all the scripts used in the framework in our [Github page](link here).


## Model code

To use our models it is very important that fish size classes in your dataset are identified correctly, otherwise your model will not be very useful. You can upload images (in JPEG or PNG format) to your Google drive by size class (i.e. fish images of each size class per folder), following this directory structure:


<pre>
<b>dataset</b>
|__ <b>class5</b>

    |______ 14167534527_781ceb1b7a_n.PNG

## Application of the model


You can also watch [**this talk**](https://youtu.be/iujl9R3lEaQ?t=5293) for the "Online seminar: Recreational angling effort and engagement in the digital age" to learn more about this model.
